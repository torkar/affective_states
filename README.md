# Replication package for the manuscript *Measuring affective states from technical debt*

* All artifacts used for the experiment can be found in `artifacts/`. A `artifacts/README.md` describes the content further.
* For replication please have a look in `docs/`, in particular `docs/index.Rmd` should be of interest. It's written in RMarkdown so fire up `RStudio` and have a look. Note, however, that one needs to install quite a lot of packages (in particular [rstan](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/rstan) and [brms](https://github.com/paul-buerkner/brms) are needed)
* The data collected from the experiment can be found in `data/`
* `analysis.R` is the original script

The replication package is also published at https://torkar.github.io/affective_states/
